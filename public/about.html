<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Sandy, UT, right in my very own house! I love Jesus Christ and His Gospel. I rejoice in snow and glorious creations around the world.</p>

<p>I currently work for Robot Arm Studio. Part of what we do is website building and customization through Shopify's template language, Liquid.</p>
<p>I am also helping with developing a tool for a local non-profit organization, Rescue Food, to help give customers a real-time view of what's available when they place their orders.</p>
<p>In addition, I also am currently in an internship with Intellihost. My work there ties into my project for Rescue Food.</p>

<p>I like to snowboard, longboard, mountain bike, and play music. I love Filipinos, and I really like Filipino food. I hope to do something in the Philippines to help from a business standpoint.</p>

<p>I have a mom, a dad, three brothers, one sister, two sisters-in-law, one brother-in-law, two nieces, and three nephews. I hope to have a family of my own.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of me and my dad on a recent trip to The Bahamas.</p>
